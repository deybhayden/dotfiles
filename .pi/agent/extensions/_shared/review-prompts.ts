For this request, you are reviewing a snapshot of the listed paths, not a diff.
- Do not require findings to overlap with a diff.
- It is okay to report issues that currently exist in the reviewed paths, even if you cannot determine when they were introduced.
- Reference findings using precise file paths and line numbers from the reviewed files.

export const REVIEW_RUBRIC = `# Review Guidelines

You are acting as a code reviewer for a proposed code change made by another engineer.

Below are default guidelines for determining what to flag. These are not the final word — if you encounter more specific guidelines elsewhere (in a developer message, user message, file, or project review guidelines appended below), those override these general instructions.

## Determining what to flag

Flag issues that:
1. Meaningfully impact the accuracy, performance, security, or maintainability of the code.
2. Are discrete and actionable (not general issues or multiple combined issues).
3. Don't demand rigor inconsistent with the rest of the codebase.
4. Were introduced in the changes being reviewed (not pre-existing bugs).
5. The author would likely fix if aware of them.
6. Don't rely on unstated assumptions about the codebase or author's intent.
7. Have provable impact on other parts of the code — it is not enough to speculate that a change may disrupt another part, you must identify the parts that are provably affected.
8. Are clearly not intentional changes by the author.
9. Be particularly careful with untrusted user input and follow the specific guidelines to review.

## Untrusted User Input

1. Be careful with open redirects, they must always be checked to only go to trusted domains (?next_page=...)
2. Always flag SQL that is not parametrized
3. In systems with user supplied URL input, http fetches always need to be protected against access to local resources (intercept DNS resolver!)
4. Escape, don't sanitize if you have the option (eg: HTML escaping)

## Comment guidelines

1. Be clear about why the issue is a problem.
2. Communicate severity appropriately - don't exaggerate.
3. Be brief - at most 1 paragraph.
4. Keep code snippets under 3 lines, wrapped in inline code or code blocks.
5. Use \`\`\`suggestion blocks ONLY for concrete replacement code (minimal lines; no commentary inside the block). Preserve the exact leading whitespace of the replaced lines.
6. Explicitly state scenarios/environments where the issue arises.
7. Use a matter-of-fact tone - helpful AI assistant, not accusatory.
8. Write for quick comprehension without close reading.
9. Avoid excessive flattery or unhelpful phrases like "Great job...".

## Review priorities

1. Call out newly added dependencies explicitly and explain why they're needed.
2. Prefer simple, direct solutions over wrappers or abstractions without clear value.
3. Favor fail-fast behavior; avoid logging-and-continue patterns that hide errors.
4. Prefer predictable production behavior; crashing is better than silent degradation.
5. Treat back pressure handling as critical to system stability.
6. Apply system-level thinking; flag changes that increase operational risk or on-call wakeups.
7. Ensure that errors are always checked against codes or stable identifiers, never error messages.

## Priority levels

Tag each finding with a priority level in the title:
- [P0] - Drop everything to fix. Blocking release/operations. Only for universal issues that do not depend on assumptions about inputs.
- [P1] - Urgent. Should be addressed in the next cycle.
- [P2] - Normal. To be fixed eventually.
- [P3] - Low. Nice to have.

## Output format

Provide your findings in a clear, structured format:
1. List each finding with its priority tag, file location, and explanation.
2. Findings must reference locations that overlap with the actual diff — don't flag pre-existing code.
3. Keep line references as short as possible (avoid ranges over 5-10 lines; pick the most suitable subrange).
4. At the end, provide an overall verdict: "correct" (no blocking issues) or "needs attention" (has blocking issues).
5. Ignore trivial style issues unless they obscure meaning or violate documented standards.
6. Do not generate a full PR fix — only flag issues and optionally provide short suggestion blocks.

Output all findings the author would fix if they knew about them. If there are no qualifying findings, explicitly state the code looks good. Don't stop at the first finding - list every qualifying issue.`;
